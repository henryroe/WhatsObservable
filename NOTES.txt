**2013-09-02 18:38:58MST:**  Project started after realized that getting PyEphem to work to an acceptable level of precision so as to be able to replace JPL/Horizons was not realistically feasible (with level of effort I was willing anyway.)  

(See evernote notes)[evernote:///view/37118715/s286/6dfedff3-d0af-42db-ab09-57141ef78f75/6dfedff3-d0af-42db-ab09-57141ef78f75/]

But, given that the Horizons What's Up? capability is not easily scripted (and lacks some parameters that would be nice) it does seem worthwhile to pursue using PyEphem for that.


# Top level requirements for MPWhatsup

*written 2013-09-07 13:32:36MST:*

* **Input:**  Selection criteria
    * Observatory code
    * Time to search  
    * Max zenith distance (deg)
    * Max visual magnitude
    * Max number of objects to return
    * Some day:
        * optional Time Range
        * Minimum duration above max airmass
* **Output:** Return is a pandas DataFrame
    * Asteroid Number
    * Asteroid Name
    * apparent magnitude
    * rise/set/transit
    * radec
    * Some day:
        * if time range given, then radec at min airmass
        * time of min airmass


# releasing a version

- change version number in whatsobservable.py
- change version number in setup.py
- make note in CHANGES.txt
- make sure everything is committed with git
- Then, e.g.:

    git tag -a 0.1.2 -m "Tagged for version 0.1.2"
    git push origin 0.1.2
    python setup.py sdist
    python setup.py bdist_wheel
    twine upload -r pypi dist/*
